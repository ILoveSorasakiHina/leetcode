## 1514. Path with Maximum Probability

### Problem Description

You are given an undirected weighted graph of n nodes (0-indexed), represented by an edge list where edges[i] = [a, b] is an undirected edge connecting the nodes a and b with a probability of success of traversing that edge succProb[i].

Given two nodes start and end, find the path with the maximum probability of success to go from start to end and return its success probability.

If there is no path from start to end, return 0. Your answer will be accepted if it differs from the correct answer by at most 1e-5.


### Examples

**Example 1:**

Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[0,2]], succProb = [0.5,0.5,0.2], start = 0, end = 2 
Output: 0.25000 
Explanation: There are two paths from start to end, one having a probability of success = 0.2 and the other has 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25.


**Example 2:**

Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[0,2]], succProb = [0.5,0.5,0.3], start = 0, end = 2 
Output: 0.30000


**Example 3:**

Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1]], succProb = [0.5], start = 0, end = 2 
Output: 0.00000 
Explanation: There is no path between 0 and 2.


### Constraints:

- 2 <= n <= 10^4
- 0 <= start, end < n
- start != end
- 0 <= a, b < n
- a != b
- 0 <= succProb.length == edges.length <= 2*10^4
- 0 <= succProb[i] <= 1
- There is at most one edge between every two nodes.

### Approach

First, convert the edges and corresponding succProb into an undirected graph.
Create a list result of length n to store the maximum probability for each node.
Initialize a heap and push the starting node with its initial probability.
Since we want the maximum probability, we use a max-heap by pushing the negative of the probabilities.
Start a loop until the heap is empty:
Pop a node node and its current probability curr_prob from the heap.
If node is equal to the target node end, return curr_prob.
For each neighbor of node, calculate the new probability new_prob by multiplying curr_prob and the edge probability.
If new_prob is greater than the stored probability for the neighbor in result, update result[neighbor] and push new_prob and neighbor into the heap.

### Python Code

```python
import heapq
from collections import defaultdict
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def maxProbability(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]], succProb: List[float], start_node: int, end_node: int) -> float:
        graph = defaultdict(list)

        # 構建圖
        for i in range(len(edges)):
            graph[edges[i][0]].append((edges[i][1], succProb[i]))
            graph[edges[i][1]].append((edges[i][0], succProb[i]))

        # 初始化結果與優先佇列
        result = [0] * n
        result[start_node] = 1
        pq = [(-1, start_node)]

        while pq:
            curr_prob, node = heapq.heappop(pq)
            curr_prob = -curr_prob

            if node == end_node:
                return curr_prob

            for neighbor, prob in graph[node]:                           
                new_prob = curr_prob * prob
                if new_prob > result[neighbor]:
                    result[neighbor] = new_prob
                    heapq.heappush(pq, (-new_prob, neighbor))

        return 0.0
