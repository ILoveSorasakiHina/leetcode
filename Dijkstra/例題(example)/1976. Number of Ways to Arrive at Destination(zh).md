1976. Number of Ways to Arrive at Destination

### 題目描述

給定一個無向圖，邊上有正的權值，請計算從節點 `0` 到節點 `n-1` 的最短路徑總數。

### 範例

**Example 1:**
Input: n = 7, roads = [[0,6,7],[0,1,2],[1,2,3],[1,3,3],[6,3,3],[3,5,1],[6,5,1],[2,5,1],[0,4,5],[4,6,2]]
output: 4
Explanation:
The shortest amount of time it takes to go from intersection 0 to intersection 6 is 7 minutes.
The four ways to get there in 7 minutes are:
- 0 ➝ 6
- 0 ➝ 4 ➝ 6
- 0 ➝ 1 ➝ 2 ➝ 5 ➝ 6
- 0 ➝ 1 ➝ 3 ➝ 5 ➝ 6

**Example 2:**

Input: n = 2, roads = [[1,0,10]]
output: 1
Explanation:
There is only one way to go from intersection 0 to intersection 1, and it takes 10 minutes.

### Constraints:

- 1 <= n <= 200
- n - 1 <= roads.length <= n * (n - 1) / 2
- roads[i].length == 3
- 0 <= ui, vi <= n - 1
- 1 <= timei <= 109
- ui != vi
- There is at most one road connecting any two intersections.
- You can reach any intersection from any other intersection.
